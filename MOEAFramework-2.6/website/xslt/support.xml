<h2>Support</h2>

<p>
  We recently transitioned to hosting the MOEA Framework source code on
  <a href="https://github.com/MOEAFramework/MOEAFramework/">Github</a>.  As a
  result, we will no longer be using the Sourceforge trackers.  Please use the
  new links below to report issues.

<h3>Report Issues</h3>

<p>
  The MOEA Framework is not bug-free, nor is any other software application,
  and reporting bugs to developers is the first step towards improving the
  reliability of software.  Critical bugs will often be addressed within days.
  Requests for new features will also be considered.
